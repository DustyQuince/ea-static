          We’ve saved $115,000 on our electric bill annually and over $15,000 in
          our maintenance costs annually. That results in a 78% energy savings
          on EA’s lighting solution alone. We highly recommend Efficiency
          Aggregators for all your lighting needs.

          The installation process went very smoothly. The electricians were 
          efficient and professional and skilled at spacing the bulbs for 
          maximum effect. The warehouse is much brighter and pleasant feeling.
