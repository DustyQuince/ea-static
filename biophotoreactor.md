    title: Light the way forward.
    subtitle: >-
      For as long as we can remember, light has been about what we can see with
      it. But as biotech and synthetic chemistry become more mature, we're
      asking new questions about light. What can we do with it? What can we 
      make with it? Photocatalysis opens up whole new classes of scientific
      synthesis and discovery, but getting the experimental conditions just
      right is no easy task, especially when there are living cells involved.
      That's where we come in.

          EA's BPR200 allows the use of light to catalyze chemical reactions in
          living and non-living systems.
      - title: Low-heat Technology

        content: >-
          The design of the device incorporates a proprietary high efficiency
          heat sink that's unique to EA. This ensures a consistent photoredox
          environment for all your experiments. 
      - title: Compatible with Living Cells

          Our experience designing energy-efficient light solutions has allowed
          us to create a device that can perform photocatalytic chemistry on
          most living cells. The low-heat, low-energy design allows living cells
          to survive and thrive during photoredox reactions.
      - title: Covalent Labeling of Biomolecules

        content: >-
          The BPR200 allows for the covalent labeling of a wide variety of
          biomolecules, including nucleic acids and proteins. And the capacity
          of up to 24 Eppendorf tubes ensures a high throughput for your
          experiments.
      - title: Support for Multiplex Photoredox Reactions

        content: >-
          In our design of the BPR200, we emphasized the ability to perform
          many reactions in parallel. The 24-vial capacity ensures that you get
          the most from your experimental runs.
